# Cut Up

For writing song lyrics. Open index.html in a browser. Input lyrics, poetry, news fragments, political speeches, etc. This program will shuffle the lines of your input for you. 

Often the program will output an interesting rearrangement that is more stimulating than your original text. If not, sometimes nonsense triggers free-association and helps you come up with more ideas.

It could be argued that all language is just cutting up words and rearranging them. David Bowie used this method to trigger fresh ideas and search his imagination. Now, you can too. 

# Other

I kind of like how plain and HTML 1.0 it all looks. Therefore, don't be surprised if I keep it that way.
