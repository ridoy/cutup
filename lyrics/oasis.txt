I live my life in the city
And there's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say, "It's just a waste of time"
Then they said, "I should feed my head"
That to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
They're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you concerned about the way I feel
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

I live my life in the city
And there's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say, "It's just a waste of time"
Then they said, "I should feed my head"
Oh, that to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
You're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you concerned about the way I feel
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

You're not down with who I am
Look at you now, you're all in my hands tonight

Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll

I'd like to be somebody else
And not know where I've been
I'd like to build myself
A house out of Plasticine

Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me

I've been driving in my car
With my friend Mister Soft
Mister Clean and Mister Benn
Are living in my loft

Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me

I'm sorry but I just don't know
I know you said I told you so
When you're happy and you're feeling fine
Then you'll know that it's the right time
Then you'll know that it's the right time

To shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me

Mister Sifter sold me songs
When I was just sixteen
Now he stops at traffic lights
But only when they're green

Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me

Ah, shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I said maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Maybe I don't really wanna know

Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever

Hey, you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly, tell me how high
Do you think you'd go
Before you start falling?
Hey you! Up in the tree
You wanna be me, well, that couldn't be
'Cause the people here
They don't hear you calling

How does it feel
When you're inside me?

Hey you! Wearing the crown
Making no sound, I've heard you feel down
Well, that's just too bad
Welcome to my world
Hey you! Stealing the light
I heard that the shine's gone out of your life
Well, that's just too bad
Welcome to my world

How does it feel
When you're inside me?

You'll need assistance with the things that you
Have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
When you're inside?
I can feel you
Can you feel me?

Hey you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly, tell me how high
Do you think you'll go
Before you start falling?
Hey you! Up in a tree
You wanna be me, well, that couldn't be
Cause the people here
They don't hear you calling

How does it feel
When you're inside me?

You'll need assistance with the things that you
Have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
When you're inside?

I've seen so much to disgust mother, take me into your arms... how am I to protect you?

There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me
There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me

I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me

What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear
What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear

So I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me

This is confusion, am I confusing you?
This is confusion, am I amusing you?
This is peculiar, we don't want to fool ya'
This is peculiar, we don't want to fool ya'

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

I need to be myself
I can't be no-one else
I'm feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonic
You can have it all, but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your BMW?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cause no-one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no-one else
I know a girl called Elsa, she's into Alka-Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffing in a tissue selling the Big Issue

When she finds out
No-one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

What was that sound ringing around your brain?
Today was just a blur you've got a head like a ghost train
What was that sound ringing around your brain?
You're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care, because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest who stays 'til the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you, but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight

Bring it on down, bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breathe

Bring it on down, bring it out of me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breathe

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care, because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest who stays 'til the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you, but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight


What a life it would be
If you could come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
We'll have lasagna
I'll treat you like a queen
I'll give you strawberries and cream
Then your friends will all go green
For my lasagna

These could be the best days of our lives
But I don't think we've been living very wise
Oh no, no

What a life it would be
If you could come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
We'll have lasagna

Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now

Hold me down all the world's asleep
Need you now you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you and we talk of growing old
But you said "Please don't!"

Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying
But I don't know what you're saying to me

Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Away

Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now

Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying
And I know just what you're saying to me

Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
We're two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Oh, let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)

(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there)
(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Don't know, don't care
All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Take me there, take me there, take me there) Slide away
(Take me there, take me there, all I know is you can take me there) Slide away
(Take me there, take me there, take me there) Slide away
(Take me there) slide away (take me there) slide away (take me there) Slide away

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye. I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye. I'm going home

I hate the way that even though you
Know you're wrong you say you're right
I hate the books you read and all your friends
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night
Up all night

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye. I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye. I'm going home

I hate the way that you are so sarcastic
And you're not very bright
You think that everything you've done's fantastic
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night
Up all night

And it will be nice to be alone
For a week or two
But I know then I will be right
Right back here with you, with you
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye. I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye. I'm going home

Sing a sad song
In a lonely place
Try to put a word in for me
It's been so long
Since I found this space
You better put in two or three
We as people, are just walking 'round
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
What we don't see
Well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel

Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong so we don't ask why
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day

If you need it
Something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If you're honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song
In a lonely place
I'll try to put a word in for you
Need a shoulder?
Well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do

Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
When we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong so we don't ask why
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day

I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun don't shine

Nobody ever mentions the weather
Can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember
Life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we
Had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
You got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes

Nobody ever mentions the weather
Can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember
Life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we
Had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says

Hello, hello
It's good to be back, it's good to be back
Hello, hello
It's good to be back, it's good to be back
Hello, hello
It's good to be back, it's good to be back
Hello, hello, hello

You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I'm gonna take me away and hide
I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide

I know the roads down which your life will drive (Life will drive)
I'll find the key that lets you slip inside (Slip inside)
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door (Behind the door)
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before

You've gotta roll with it
You've gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

If you're coming with me
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

So, Sally can wait

So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger
I heard you say
At least not today

I hitched a ride with my soul by the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I've gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me?
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you?
You're standing ignoring me

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now, hey now

Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame

The first thing I saw as I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know that I want you to know
What's written inside of your head
And time as it stands won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky, I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in?

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now, hey now

Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame

Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame

I hitched a ride with my soul by the side of the road

Hey now
Hey now
Hey now
Hey now
Hey now
Hey now, hey now

Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame

Some might say that sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today 'cause they hold sway over time

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation
For my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently
But it's all elementary my friend

Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
That made no preparation
For my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
And my dog's been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again

Some might say (Some might say)
Some might say (Some might say)

Here's a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands (What's in his hands)
He walks along the open road of love and life
Surviving if he can (Surviving if he can)

Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow (Hi-high)

As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow

(Hi-high, hi-high, hi-high)

She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And God only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
"Do you know what I'm saying?"
But I need more

'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me
She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
"Do you know what I'm saying?"
But I need more
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?


All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well

What's the story morning glory?
Well?
You need a little time to wake up wake up
Well?
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
Need a little time to wake up wake up

All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade

Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Need a little time to wake up

You know you should so I guess you might as well

What's the story morning glory?
Well?
You need a little time to wake up wake up
Well?
What's the story morning glory?

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?

Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky

Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?

Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova

'Cause people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball

Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me

In a champagne supernova

The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why

We were getting high

You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
Just depends on what kind of car you are

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I met a funny looking girl
On a crowded beach in Spain
Her name was Avaline
She said she came to Spain to have a good time
But she was with her mum
Who had a face like a nun in pain
She said her name was Dot
She didn't half talk a lot
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Mad or not
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Don't you know – I should have stayed in England
On my polluted beach – with all my special friends
And don't you know – I should have stayed in England
With my big house and my big car
And all my friends they're at the bar
La la laaaaaaa

You know I need a little break

Or I could steal a car
