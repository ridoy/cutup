Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied, I knew it was just stable
Children trying hard not to realize
I was sitting right behind you

Dear, can't you see? It's them, it's not me
We're not enemies, we just disagree
If I was like him, all pissed in this bar
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree, I think we should disagree, yeah

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired


Up on a hill, here's where we begin
This little story, a long time ago
Start to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending

Oh, in the sun, sun, having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go
Oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so I'll pretend I'm leaving

I feel so different now, we trained at A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed, my vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

Oh, in the sun, sun, having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go, woo!
Darling, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so this is why I'm leaving

Soma is what they would take when
Hard times opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way
High stakes for a few names
Racing against sunbeams
Losing against fig trees
In your eyes

And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
See, I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes

Let's go

When I saw her for the first time
Lips moved as her eyes closed
Heard something in his voice
"And I'll be there," he says
Then he walks out
Somehow he was trying
Too hard to be like them

And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
And I am
Stop
Oh, darling let me go

Tried it once and they liked it
And tried to hide it
Says, "I've been doing this twenty-five years"
Well, I'm not listening no more
And these friends, they keep asking for more
Oh, yeah, oh, but that's it

I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
But like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it don't make any sense
These strange manners, I love 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trenchcoat?

I should have worked much harder
I should have just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
And something that you learned yesterday
Drive you to work and you'll be on time
These little problems, they're not yours, they're mine
Come on, listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay

I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing

And all together, it went well
We made pretend, we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, you're a freak"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
But for the record, it's between you and I

Oh, I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
And like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it just don't make any sense
Oh, strange manners, I love 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trenchcoat?

I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing

And all together, it went well
We made pretend, we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, I can wait"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
But for the record, it's between you and I

In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
I see alone we stand; together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time

Trying, trying

And now my fears, they come to me in threes
So I sometimes
Say, "Fate, my friend, you say the strangest things
I find sometimes"

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Shit, I will try my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right
I see alone we stand; together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
I ain't wasting no more time

No choice now, it's too late
Let him go, he gave up
I gave up
Lisa said, "Take time for me"
Dropping him down to his knees
Ah, chest down

Take me away
See I've got to explain
Things, they have changed
In such a permanent way
Life seems unreal
Can we go back to your place?
Oh, "You drink too much"
Makes me drink just the same

People tried. Felt so right
Giving themselves good advice
Looking down sometimes felt nice

He knows it's justified to kill to survive
He then, in dollars, makes more dead than alive
Let's suck more blood, let's run three hours a day
The world is over but I don't care
'Cause

I am with you
Now I've got to explain
Things, they have changed
In such a permanent way
Life seems unreal
Can we go back to your place?
"You drink too much"
Makes me drink just the same

The first time, it happened too fast
The second time, I thought it would last

We all like it a little different


Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door

Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen, oh, minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

And say, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah

Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah


Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone, tried to take control
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

We shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame, says we're all the same
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her
When we go back

I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo
You're right, it's true

He said he can't decide
I shake my head to say, "Everything's just great."
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember

Raised in Carolina
She says, "I'm not like that."
Trying to remind her
When we go back

I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
Oh man, can't you see, I'm nervous, so please
Pretend to be nice so I can be mean
I missed the last bus, we'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain

Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks my friend, thought it was too late."
Oh, why, oh, why? I don't know
So you think things move pretty fast down here?
Well, just wait, my dear, 'til you look up there
Oh, maybe someday you'll know
Had his second kid, was an early night
Got to be well-dressed, 'cause he hates to fly
Oh, loves his job, takes it home

Anything they wanted
They could have it, have it
Didn't even notice
I don't mind it, mind it

Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks my friend, thought that we was dead."
Oh why, oh, why? I don't know
Think things move pretty fast down here?
But just wait, my dear, 'til we get up there
Oh, maybe someday, they'll know

Come on, tell me does she warm the room
When he comes?
Or does he just know
How to leave when it gets cold?

Well, I don't care, I don't care
'Cause it's free

You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before, I know
And sold you on their way
Oh, honey, that's okay

No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
When I find out
I hope it's you who set this trap

And store fronts rarely change
At least I'm on my own again
Instead of anywhere with you
Oh, tell me it's all the same

And I've lost my page again
I know this is surreal, but I'll try my luck with you
Oh, this life is on my side, oh, I am your one
Believe me, this is a chance, oh, oh

Let's see what is for sale
He's trying not to give his job a chance
Oh, it's never gonna be
It's sad, but I agree
The signals don't seem right
It lasts for just one night and then
I'm sorry that I said
That we were just good friends

No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
Entranced, I can't be here in time
I'll think about that

And I've lost my page again
I know this is surreal, but I'll try my luck with you
Oh, this life is on my side, oh, I am your one
Believe me, oh, this is a chance, oh, oh

Leave me alone
I'm in control, I'm in control
And girls act too much and boys act too tough
Enough is enough
Well, on the minds of other men, I know she was

I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, and take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, oh, take it

I say, oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down, he's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends, if he can
He's gonna win someday

I fell off the track, now I can't go back
I'm not like that
Boys act too much, girls act too tough
Enough is enough
Well, on the minds of other girls, I know he was

I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, and take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, oh, take it

Oh, that's right, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down, he's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends, if he can
He's gonna win someday, oh, he will


I'm putting your patience to the test
I'm putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice

Sellin' your body to the street
Sending your girlfriends to the night, for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sealing a letter made with horse's feet
And now you've heard that

Waves turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA
Platinum's on the rise
Sleeping in the sky
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

I'm putting your patience to the test
I'm putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice
And now you've seen that

Blondes turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA
Porn's on the rise
Psychos in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

Darling, ain't nobody gonna tell us
They're gonna be oh so jealous
We're gonna be oh so silent
They're gonna be stoned in silence
(I didn't want to ask you, baby)
(I didn't want to have to ask anybody, baby)
(Is anyone asking maybe?)
(Can anyone even hear me?)

Why are you waiting beyond the door?

Life turns to dust
And rain turns to rust
Gossip is a truth
And money pays for the lies we trust
Your love is a surprise
Homeless saints are in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A nice place for you and I


Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning yelling, "No more!"
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll be waiting for you

Happiness is two different things
What you take and then what you bring
One is pleasure, one's discipline
One's devotion, one's just the ring

Desire and reward
Long term and short term joy

Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart

One has nothing to do with the other
And the world is all cousins not brothers

Hard to take you off of my love
One's an instant, one takes some will
One gives life, and one makes you kill
One's the means and one's for the end

Desire and reward
Long term and short term joy

Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart

One has nothing to do with the other
And the world is all cousins not brothers

Don't you give in
You're beginning


Tell me what happened, tell me what happened
Tell me what happened if you like
Get off on the same floor, get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor every night

What are the reasons? What are the reasons?
What are the reasons to find more?
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you nothing more

In my mind, gave a hand
Never once, gave a damn

I'm done with the office, I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office, hello, forest
I still wanna ask you, I still wanna ask you
I still wanna ask you something more

In my mind, gave a hand
Never once, gave a damn

I don't wanna fight, don't wanna beg, you any-
I don't wanna fight, don't wanna beg, you any-
I don't wanna fight, don't wanna beg, you anymore

I don't wanna argue, I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue, you think you won
I wouldn't hurt you, I wouldn't hurt you
Well, maybe I'd hurt you, if I could

Sister, it feels like just yesterday
Sister, don't you forget my number
On this door?
You've got something and it's so good to see
Something wonderful that I could not be
Everybody hanging on for their lives
But you can't help them 'cause you don't have the time

I know everyone goes any damn place they like
I hope this goes over well on the toxic radio, yeah

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You're so gullible but I don't mind
Oh, that's not the problem
And I don't need anyone with me right now
Monday, Tuesday is my weekend
You get taken for a fool all the time
I don't know why

Blame yourself for once, quit putting it on me
I can't help you 'cause I've seen what it means
It's so early, I don't want to wake up
Oh, we're so lucky 'cause we never grow up
Mama, it feels like just yesterday
Mama, don't you forget my number?
I don't want to be the one at the door

I know, everyone goes any damn place they choose
And I hope everyone well on the toxic radio
A tourist in the ghetto, not afraid of anything
Except death and anything else that could maybe hurt them, oh yeah

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You're so gullible but I don't mind
Oh, that's not the problem
And I don't need anyone with me right now
Monday, Tuesday is my weekend
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
I don't know why

With all the noise above
He tried to call his name
The trial would go on
The day has just begun

Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world

The diamond cuts her eye
The crowd behind went wild
They weren't all that proud
By now, they hear it loud

Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world

I'm OK, I'm alright
I was out late last night
Empty love
Empty love
I will wait one more night

Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late

I look for you
And you look for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you

Wait time is to blame
Mapped out fame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed

I look for you
And you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

(Waking up is so much fun to do)
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you
(An eighties-movie make-out party with you)
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you

Oh b-baby, don't you be so mad because I barely remember
And she tries to recognize me with the eyes she saw me with in December
And she's starting to realize that it's actually not a good thing
And it's so tough because you're down to go out again and have another adventure
All her friends in the alleyway shout back, but she can't hear them

But you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sun
Get up in the morning and run
You'll be frustrated 'til the day that you're done

He got punched in the mouth for sticking his nose in other people's business
No good solution, always on the verge of some revolution
Well tough luck it may take a thousand years but I think we can do it
Best friends fight, but they never enjoy life as good as when they abuse it
He said, "The soldier is a necessity in light of all the failures of man."

But you're never gonna get their love
We can only fight in the sand
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone

He could never mention it out here and now
Without quick tears in his eyes

But you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sun
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone

Oh you're never gonna get this love
We can roll around in the dark
That's about as far as we go
Get up in the morning and run

I wanna be outrageous
But inside, I know I'm plain
So plain

Just plain
Boring and plain

Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone, I guess
Trying for the perfect life
End up being in denial

I wanna be somebody
Wanna be somebody like you
Like you
Like you

Like you
Instead of me

Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone, I guess
Trying for the perfect life
End up being in denial


Animals on TV singing about some pain that they once felt
There's no one I disapprove of more or root for more than myself
I wanted to pretend that it was better, better, better on the phone
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous and alone

So we talk about ourselves in hell
To forget the love we never felt
All the old jokes that work so well
Universal truth was a moment's lie

Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Get out of the way

Got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost I see
She sees her father in that old man's eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs
Animals on TV singing about some pain they felt at some point
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous, what's the point?

As I watch the velvet drapes appear
And the door was closed for forty years
As we hide what we don't wanna hear
As we hide what's really in our ears

He is coming from a part of hell
Where lightning blue eyes don't go down well
He can tell that we're oblivious
It's addiction of routine as well
Making fools out of the best of us
Making robots of the rest of us
Innocence itself in America today
Is a crime, just like Cornel West might say

Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Get out of the way
